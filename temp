Engraving On Metal Plates
            According to Joseph Smith, he translated the Book of Mormon from an original text which was engraved on metal plates. In the text, the ancient authors mentioned how precious the space was on the plates, and they gave as their reason for writing in Egyptian (or "reformed" Egyptian) that this language required less space than Hebrew, their native language. This claim does not hold up under examination.
“And as these plates are small, and as these things are written for the intent of the benefit of our brethren the Lamanites, wherefore, it must needs be that I write a little; but I shall not write the things of my prophesying, nor of my revelations. .” 
“And I, Jarom, do not write more, for the plates are small.” - Jarom 2, 14
“And if our plates had been sufficiently large we should have written in Hebrew; ..... “ - Mormon 9:33

“ And now, behold, we have written this record according to our knowledge, in the characters which are called among us the reformed Egyptian, being handed down and altered by us, according to our manner of speech.
“... the Hebrew hath been altered by us also; and if we could have written in Hebrew, behold, ye would have had no imperfection in our record.” - Mormon 9:32-33

"Reformed Egyptian"
            Does it make sense that writing in Hebrew would have required so much more space than writing in some form of Egyptian?
            At the time of Lehi there were three written forms of Egyptian: Hieroglyphic (stone & papyrus, from ca 2700 BC), Hieratic (ink on papyrus, from 2700 BC), and Demotic (all media, from 650 BC).

            Here is an example of a short sentence written in hieroglyphic Egyptian:

Hieroglyphics for 'I have given bread'
The characters were pronounced "au er-tana tau" and mean "I have given bread."
            In Hebrew this could be written in seven Hebrew characters, pronounced "nathati lechem" (reading right to left):

Hebrew characters for NTTI LHM
If one were to use Hebrew characters to write the Egyptian sounds, the Hebrew characters would be (also reading right to left):

Hebrew characters for 'W 'RTN TW
pronounced "au er-tana tau." Clearly, hieroglyphic Egyptian would not have saved space on the metal plates.
            Hieratic Egyptian is derived directly from the hieroglyphic, and is no more space-saving. But what about demotic? It is essentially an alphabet, like Hebrew, with each character representing a sound. Here is the demotic alphabet:


            And here is the Hebrew alphabet, for comparison:


            For comparison, here is the only sample of characters from the plates that exists, the so-called "Anthon Transcript," which Martin Harris took to New York to show to language professors at Columbia.


An interesting analysis of these "Caractors" by Richard Stout titled “A Singular Discovery” shows a possible origin for them in the "Detroit Manuscript," an obscure document which has connections to Joseph Smith's uncle and to Professor Mitchill at Columbia, who referred Harris to Anthon.

            One must ask then, why would any Hebrew writer engraving onto metal tablets feel that he would save a great deal of space by using demotic characters rather than Hebrew? It would seem there would be no saving of space at all. Also, the fact that the Jews considered their language sacred, there would be no reason whatsoever for them to keep sacred records in a foreign language, especially the language of a people who had oppressed and enslaved them.
            Some Mormon apologists have pointed out that archaeologists have indeed found Egyptian writings in ancient Palestine, and even some sacred Jewish texts written in Egyptian. Those can be easily explained: Egyptians often occupied Palestine, so it would not be unusual to find Egyptian writing there. There is no reason to assume that Egyptian writings in Palestine were written by Jews and not Egyptians. At most they would be written by bilingual Jews for Egyptian readers who did not know Hebrew. That certainly would not be the case for Lehi's followers to write in Egyptian. They had no audience whose only language was Egyptian.

            A modern example might be the fact that during the German occupation of France in the 1940s there were obviously a number of publications in German, for use of the occupation forces. Some Frenchmen were probably bilingual, and made translations of French materials into German for German readers. But it would be extremely unlikely that French speakers who escaped their occupied homeland and found refuge in other countries would have written their diaries in German. And the Jews with Lehi would just as unlikely have written their records in Egyptian.

            Why then, did the Nephites choose to write in a form of Egyptian?   The obvious answer seems to be that Joseph Smith felt he was less likely to be exposed if he showed plates with engravings in a still-undeciphered language (Egyptian) than in a relatively better-known language (Hebrew).   To add an additional degree of safety, he claimed that the Egyptian had been "altered."     His Egyptian ploy finally caught up with him in the Book of Abraham.

Editing "on the fly"
            One must imagine the Nephite authors working with a stylus on their metal plates, painstakingly etching each character. Surely they must have planned carefully what they were going to write, before putting stylus to metal. But there are numerous passages in the Book of Mormon which look like they are the product of rapid dictation, with corrections made "on the fly." They seem quite unlike the product of "think before you write." A few of the many examples:
“Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates, which gives an account, or which gives a greater account of the wars and contentions...” - 1 Nephi 19:4
“Yea, even the very God of Israel do men trample under their feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would speak in other words—they set him at naught, ...” - 1 Nephi 19:7

“..who went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi” - Mosiah 7:1

“..and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest..” - Mosiah 8:17

“..king Noah sent his armies against them, and they were driven back, or they drove them back for a time..” - Mosiah 11:18

(For a listing of over 100 such passages, click here)
Wordiness
            Another characteristic of the Book of Mormon text that makes one skeptical about its having been engraved on metal plates where space was precious, is the extreme wordiness of many passages. Many examples could be cited. Here are just a few, with the original text on the left and the same information in a more space-saving form on the right, for comparison:
“And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom; and the land round about” - Mosiah 7:21 (77 words)
“Ye all know that Zeniff was overzealous to become king. He was deceived by king Laman and ceded to him by treaty the cities Lehi-Nephi and Shilom and surrounding lands” (30 words)
"And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon, yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest that was near the waters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever." - Mosiah 18:30 (74 words)
"All this happened in Mormon, where the waters and forest are so beautiful to those who are blessed to know their Redeemer and who shall sing his praise forever." (29 words)
And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which have the records of the holy scriptures upon them, which have the genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning—
4 Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and handed down from one generation to another, and be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, that they shall know of the mysteries contained thereon.
5 And now behold, if they are kept they must retain their brightness; yea, and they will retain their brightness; yea, and also shall all the plates which do contain that which is holy writ.
6 Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.
7 And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.
8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things should be preserved; for behold, they have enlarged the memory of this people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls.
9 Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these records do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea, these records and their words brought them unto repentance; that is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.
10 And who knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing many thousands of them, yea, and also many thousands of our stiffnecked brethren, the Nephites, who are now hardening their hearts in sin and iniquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer?
11 Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; therefore I shall forbear.
12 And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a wise purpose, which purpose is known unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round. - Alma 37:3-12 (423 words)
These brass plates, with scriptures and genealogies, are to be handed down and preserved to go forth to all nations, because by small things the Lord performs great things in confounding the wise and saving souls. They have already reminded thousands of the errors of their ways and brought them knowledge of the Lord and Christ. And many more will be brought to that knowledge by these plates, which are preserved for a purpose which I do not know. (79 words)
And they were built after a manner that they were exceedingly TIGHT, even that they would hold water LIKE UNTO A DISH; and the bottom thereof was TIGHT LIKE UNTO A DISH; and the sides thereof were TIGHT LIKE UNTO A DISH; and the ends thereof were peaked; and the top thereof was TIGHT LIKE UNTO A DISH; and the length thereof was the length of a tree; and the door thereof, when it was shut, was TIGHT LIKE UNTO A DISH. - Ether 2:17 (82 words, emphasis added)	And they were made very tight to hold water, like a dish. Also the bottom, sides, top, and door (when shut) were tight. The ends were peaked and it was as long as a tree. (34 words)
Unnecessary repetition
            Another characteristic of the Book of Mormon text is the frequent unnessary repetition, again arousing suspicion that the original text was not being engraved on metal in such a way as to conserve space. How often does Nephi have to remind the reader of his identity by repeating "I, Nephi..." (84 times in 1 Nephi and 2 Nephi)?
            Here are more examples of unnecessary repetition (see also the "tight like unto a dish" passage above):

“Now behold, how great reason we have to mourn. Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to mourn.” - Mosiah 7:23-24
“And there cometh a resurrection, even a first resurrection; yea, even a resurrection of those that have been, and who are, and who shall be, even until the resurrection of Christ..” - Mosiah 15:21

“And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a little child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things.
"And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in my name, and become as a little achild, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. - 3 Nephi 11:37-38

" And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me. ... 
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost.
"And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy Ghost will bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the Father, and I, and the Holy Ghost are one." - 3 Nephi 11:32-36, emphasis added


            These examples of on-the-fly editing, wordiness, and unecessary repetition could be multiplied a hundredfold. Open any page of the Book of Mormon and you will find them. They are completely inconsistent with the claim that the original text was engraved by the authors on metal plates. But they are quite consistent with a conclusion that the Book of Mormon is a text which got its final form while being dictated, and that the author(s), rather than trying to conserve precious space, was trying to expand the volume of the text. Larger, longer books are more impressive, and can demand a higher price on the market.

Linguistic Criticisms Which are Not Valid, or Quite Weak
            However much we might appreciate criticism of Mormonism, there are a few linguistic objections - mostly to the Book of Mormon - which are not valid or not convincing. At the risk of being accused of defending Mormonism, I will point them out.
Reformed Egyptian
            Some critics have objected that there is no such known language as "Reformed Egyptian." This objection fails on two counts. First, just because an ancient language is not yet known, one should not assume that it does not exist. Previously unknown languages are frequently discovered. Second, there is no reason to suppose that an ancient, isolated people such as the Lehites, using Egyptian as their language, would not modify it over the course of centuries. That is a very common phenomenon. Modern English, for example, might justifiably be called "Reformed Anglo-Saxon," or modern Italian might well be referred to as "Reformed Latin."
"And it came to pass..."
            One of the most frequent criticisms of the language of the Book of Mormon is the frequent use of the phrase "And it came to pass..." That may well be a valid criticism of the literary style of the supposed translation, but that criticism overlooks the fact that the very same phrase occurs quite frequently in the King James translation of the Bible, over 500 times in the Hebrew Old Testament and over 70 times in the Greek New Testament. The phrase in the New Testament is a translation of the one Greek word 'egeneto' meaning "it happened." In the Old Testament it translates a word of four characters, pronounced 'weyehi' meaning "and it happened." It is not unreasonable to assume that "Reformed Egyptian" might also have had such a single short word.
"adieu" (Jacob 7:27)
            The fact that a French word is used in an English translation does not mean that the original text had that same French word. "Adieu" is used in English in a special sense, a final farewell to one whom one does not expect to see ever again. If there were a word with such a specific meaning in an original text, it would be quite appropriate to translate it into English with the French word, since English has no word which is an exact equivalent.
" the cold and silent grave, from whence no traveler can return" (2 Nephi 1:14)
            Critics object that this is a quotation from Shakespeare's Hamlet, from the famous soliloquy beginning "To be, or not to be..." The line there is: "the undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns." (Hamlet III:1)
            The metaphor, however, is not unique with Shakespeare. It occurs also in the Bible: "I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death" (Job 10:21)


Linguistic Arguments in Favor of Mormon Claims
            Mormon apologists also use linguistic evidence in support of Mormon claims.   The supposed similarity of Book of Mormon names to genuine Egyptian or Hebrew names has already been discussed above. The most important of the other claims will be discussed here.

Wordprint Studies
            Some Mormon apologists claim that wordprint studies confirm one claim of the Book of Mormon, namely that it is the work of multiple authors (Nephi, Jacob, Alma, etc.).   "Wordprint" refers to a statistical analysis (usually done by computer) of different texts to discover supposedly subconcious stylistic peculiarities of the author(s), such as preference for particular phrases or words.   (See for example the official Mormon publication Ensign, January 2000, "Mounting Evidences for the Book of Mormon".)
            The techniques used in wordprint studies are still subject to much debate (not just among those studying Mormon writings) and the basic premises are questioned.   Even one prominent Mormon apologist, John Tvedtnes, has rejected such evidence for the Book of Mormon (see Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, 33:1:85-87).   For other criticism of these studies, see Issue #84 of the Salt Lake City Messenger, "New Computer Study".and "Book of Mormon Wordprints Re-examined" by D. James Croft. For a concise summary of several studies, see "Conflicting Results..." at http://www.religioustolerance.org/ldsbom1.htm.


Chiasm in the Book of Mormon
            Mormon apologists have made much of the discovery of chiasms in the Book of Mormon.   A chiasm (also called "chiasmus"), named after the Greek letter 'chi' which resembles the letter 'X', is a literary device where a series of statements or phrases is followed by a reversed restatement of the same phrases: A, B, C, D, d, c, b, a.
            This literary device was discovered in the Bible in the 19th century, and Mormon apologists discovered it then also in the Book of Mormon.   They present this as evidence that the Book of Mormon is divinely inspired, since chiasm had not yet been recognized in the Bible when Joseph Smith produced the Book of Mormon.

            Chiasm loses all of its persuasiveness as evidence for the divinity of the Book of Mormon when one realizes that it is a literary device which can occur quite naturally in non-divine writings as well, and that an author need not be consciously aware of the device, nor know its name, to make literary use of it.   Joseph Smith's diary, for example, does not claim to be divinely inspired nor to be an ancient document, yet the entry for April 1, 1834, is an excellent example of chiasm:

A  the Lord shall destroy him
   B  who has lifted his heel against me even that wicked man Docter P. H[u]rlbut
       C  he [will] deliver him to the fowls of heaven
              and
       c  his bones shall be cast to the blast of the wind
   b  [for] he lifted his [arm] against the Almity
a  therefore the Lord shall destroy him
            The third president of the church, John Taylor, used chiasm quite naturally, and no Mormon claims that the chiasm in his reflections are either evidence of divine inspiration or of ancient origin:

A  And He in His own person
   B  bore the sins of all,
      C  and atoned for them
         D  by the sacrifice of Himself,
            E  so there came upon Him the weight and agony
               F  of ages
               f  and generations,
            e  the indescribable agony consequent upon
         d  this great sacrificial
      c  atonement
   b  wherein He bore the sins of the world,
a  and suffered in His own person the consequences of an eternal   
   law of God broken by man
(The above examples are from Brent Lee Metcalfe, Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol.26, No.3, pp.162-164.)
            A tongue-in-cheek article in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol 33 No. 4, Winter 2000, p 163, by Robert Patterson, "Hebraicisms, Chiasmus, and Other Internal Evidence for Ancient Authorship in 'Green Eggs and Ham'" demonstrated that the same arguments which Mormon apologists use to show that chiasm is evidence for the Book of Mormon can also show that Dr. Seuss' children's book "Green Eggs and Ham" is also ancient:

I am Sam.
Sam I am.

I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
  I do not like green eggs and ham.
    Would you like them here or there?
      I would not like them here or there.
    I would not like them anywhere.
  I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
            Vernal Holley, in his book Book of Mormon Authorship: A Closer Look, 3rd ed., p 26, (on line here) points out that Solomon Spaulding's "Manuscript Story" (also called "Manuscript Found"), considered by many - including Holley - to be a major source of Joseph Smith's Book of Mormon, also contains quite a few examples of chiasmus.   And yet no Mormon apologist would consider that fact as evidence that Spaulding's story is actually Hebrew scripture.

            For a thorough discussion of how frequent (and natural) chiasmus is, see Dr. Mardy Grothe's website at http://www.drmardy.com/chiasmus/welcome.shtml. He gives no indication that chiasmus is evidence of antiquity or of divinity (nor does he mention the Book of Mormon).

Claims of Similar Vocabulary - Semitic and Native American
            Some Mormon apologists point to comments by Dr. Roger William Westcott, linguistics professor at Drew University, and Dr. Mary Ritchie Key, who have written on the similarities between many words in Native American languages and the languages of the Bible lands.   Westcott and Key, however, did not base their comments on their own research, but rather on research by Mormon Brian Stubbs.   Stubbs simply scoured vocabularies to compile his listing.   However, similarities of vocabulary (as any real comparative linguist should know) are not enough to establish a connection between languages.   There are far too many such similarities that are pure coincidence.   For example, Greek 'ho' means "the" and Hebrew 'ha' means "the" Does that indicate that Greek and Hebrew are related?   Absolutely not.   Aztec 'pax' means "war" and Latin 'pax' means the opposite: "peace".   Is that evidence that Aztec and Latin are related?   No.   Greek 'theos' and Latin 'deus' both mean "god".   Striking similarity, but they are completely different roots, even though Latin and Greek ARE related.
            I would guess that a careful search of Chinese and English would turn up a list of words with similar appearance and similar meaning.   Would any linguist accept that as evidence that Chinese and English are related, or that one is derived from the other?

            Mormon apologists defend Stubbs' work by pointing out that he also shows patterns of sound shifts, such as have been observed in known language families such as the Indo-European group (which includes most modern and ancient European languages), in addition to the similarities in individual vocabulary items.   However, Stubbs does not present nearly the quantity of examples that support the Indo-European sound shifts (the most widespread IE shift is known as "Grimm's Law").

            Stubbs is Mormon and writing for a Mormon audience.   He has flummoxed two retired linguistic professors (Key is now dead, actually).   What about the thousands of other reputable linguists who are not convinced?   Only lay people are convinced by vocabulary lists such as Stubbs'.   (For many more such vocabulary similarities, see http://tinyurl.com/52w8t8.)

            See also the article "Setting the Record Straight About Native Languages: Linguistic Relationships" at http://www.native-languages.org/iaq3.htm#4.

            For another example of an attempt to use vocabulary similarities to support the Book of Mormon see the article "Lehi in the Pacific" by L. Dwayne Samuelson here with my rebuttal.


Conclusion
            In light of the many linguistic blunders and erroneous translations made by this man who claimed to be a divinely inspired "translator," it is difficult to see why anyone with any understanding of linguistic phenomena would accept his claims.   Joseph Smith was quite ignorant of languages, in spite of his boasting of his abilities and divine inspiration, and when one examines his linguistic claims and his supposedly divine linguistic accomplishments, one must conclude that if his god inspired him, his god was as poor a linguist as he was.
            Mormonism's claims fail on many other fronts besides linguistics.   But even a few of the gross linguistic errors as discussed here should be sufficient to show that Smith's claims are no more than the boastings of an ignorant (although charismatic) human being.
